Depending on what you want the file to contain:

touch /path/to/file for an empty file
somecommand > /path/to/file for a file containing the output of some command.

  eg: grep --help > randomtext.txt
      echo "This is some text" > randomtext.txt
nano /path/to/file or vi /path/to/file (or any other editor emacs,gedit etc)
It either opens the existing one for editing or creates & opens the empty file to enter, if it doesn't exist

shareedit
